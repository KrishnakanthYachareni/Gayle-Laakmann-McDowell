## Coding Interview Tips During interview
--------------------------------------------------------------	

1. Always define meaningful variable names (Should descriptively define)

2. Abstraction (Modularize the code, Write helpers methods)

3. Documentation: Not all algorithms are needed it but few of them are required.
   Add the code comment on the line if code lines are complicated.

4. Descriptive code: Write the code which is so readable. Example:
   In code if condition has the more logical cond, then write it in separate unit and assign a boolean meaning full name.

5. Idiomatic style code: Write better version of programming language. Like java8 (Know your language is better)

6. Testing: Create a solid tests, Edge cases (Or Explain to interviewer verbally)
