Here’s what to expect in an Amazon Interview Process

◈ Recruiter Call (20-30 mins)[No coding]

Questions related to your professional experience and expectations.
Discussion around the team they are hiring for. Feel free to ask any questions.

◈ Online Assessment

You need to solve 2/3 DSA questions within 2/3 hours on a coding platform.
You will be informed about the number of questions and duration before hand

◈ The actual rounds (4-5 interviews) - Coding, LLD and HLD

The rounds are pretty templatized:
1) Duration - 1 hour.
2) Questions about Amazon's leadership principles.
3) Except for the bar raiser round, all your rounds shall be conducted by someone from the team you are being hired for.

➡ 1-2 Coding Rounds - There will be 2 DSA questions in the round, and you are expected to come up with the most optimized solution.

➡ Low-Level Design Round - You will be expected to write LLD for some system that is loosely relevant to your job. Ex: Design Alexa

➡ High-Level Design Round - This round shall be based on your profile (frontend or backend).

➡ Bar Raiser Design Round - This is again a coding round. There will be 2 DSA questions in the round, and you are expected to come up with the most optimized solution.

◈ Amazon Leadership principles

Every round has some time reserved for asking leadership principle questions.
