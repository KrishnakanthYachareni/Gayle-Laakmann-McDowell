### Object Oriented Design
Steps to follow before begin writing code are
<br>
**Step 1:** Ask list of features and clarification about the requirements.
and write down the high level requirements

**Step 2:** Identify key Objects

**Step 3:** Identify the supported operations by each object.

**Step 4:** Identify the Interactions between objects.

**Step 5:** Discuss the `Design Patterns` and `SOLID` principles that you would apply in code.

**Step 6:** Finally, start writing the code.


## Software Design Principles
1. ### [SOLID Principles](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-are-the-solid-principles-in-java)
    | Principle  | Description |
    | ------------- | ------------- |
    | Single Responsibility Principle  | Each class should be responsible for a single part or functionality of the system. |
    | Open-Closed Principle | Software components should be open for extension, but not for modification.  |
    | Liskov Substitution Principle| Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the system.|
    | Interface Segregation Principle | No client should be forced to depend on methods that it does not use.|
    | Dependency Inversion Principle| High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions.

2. [DRY - Don’t Repeat Yourself](https://thefullstack.xyz/dry-yagni-kiss-tdd-soc-bdfu)
   1. It refers to code writing methodology. DRY usually refers to code duplication. If we write the same logic more than once, we should “DRY up our code.
   2. A common way to DRY up code is to wrap our duplicated logic with a function and replace all places it appears with function calls
3. [KISS – Keep It Simple Stupid](https://thefullstack.xyz/dry-yagni-kiss-tdd-soc-bdfu)
   1. Keeping it simple surpsingly hard. Usually when someone tries to over-engineer a soluiton to a problem. 
   2. For example an Architect suggests creating a Microservice framework for a simple website. The Engineer will then say: “Let’s KISS it and do something simpler”.
   3. Another rule of thumb is whenever you think to yourself “Finally I’m going to use something from my Computer Science degree,” you should probably KISS it.
4. [YAGNI – You Aren’t Gonna Need It](https://thefullstack.xyz/dry-yagni-kiss-tdd-soc-bdfu)
   1. A step brother of KISS. Part of keeping it simple is not adding modules, frameworks and dependencies we don’t actually need.
