Question No 1:
--------------------
Find the top 10 trending hashtags in twitter. You can write a standalone java class(es) / interfaces as deemed to be fit.
Assumptions &amp;notes :
1) A tweet is a text being input by tweeters.
2) A main method in a java class to be implemented which takes the tweet as an input.
3) You need to extract hashtag from a tweet text (Ex:sachin is hashtag in the tweet -> "Worlds best cricketer
is #sachin")
4) Maintain a data structure that keeps tracking of the count of each hashtag that is coming to your main
method
5) print the list of top 10 hashtags at the end of main method execution


Data Structures used:
----------------------
1. Priority Queue/Minheap: Min Heap of size k to keep top k most frequent hashTag words (where k = 10)
2. LinkedHashMap: To keep the frequency of each word.

Solution Approach:
---------------------
1. Extracted the hashTags from given Tweet text.
2. Calculated the frequency of all the hashTags and inserting into LinkedHashMap.
3. Start adding pair Node of word(hashTag) and its frequency into a min heap where we use the frequency as the key for the min heap.
4. If the minHeap is full then remove the minimum element (top) by doing minify form the minHeap and add the new node(word-frequency pair) only
   if the frequency of current word has frequency greater than the top word in the heap.
5. Once we iterate all the words in the map and the minHeap is properly updated and it contains top 10 most frequent hashTags.

Time Complexity:
---------------------
n + n log k = O(n log k)
where k = 10 and for each element we perform minify which takes log k time. another n for heaping(map).

Space Complexity:
---------------------
n + k -> O(n)
where k = 10

Sample Input:
---------------------
Elon Musk co-founded and leads #Tesla, #SpaceX, #Neuralink and The Boring #US Companies. As the co-founder and CEO of #Tesla, Elon leads all product design, engineering and global manufacturing of the company's electric vehicles, battery products and solar energy products and #Tesla also produces three energy storage products, the #Powerwall home battery, the #Powerpack commercial-scale battery, and Megapack, which is designed for utility-scale installations.Trump becomes the 45th #US President Potentially habitable exoplanet #ProximaB discovered #RogerFederer wins #US Open for 5th time #GravitationalWaves detection successful Traces of liquid water discovered on #Mars Life Could Survive on Exoplanet #ProximaB Go go #RogerFederer Ten ways #ProximaB is different from Earth ISRO becomes 4th space agency to reach #Mars #RogerFederer beats #Nadal

Sample Output:
---------------------
#Tesla
#US
#RogerFederer
#ProximaB
#Mars
#Powerpack
#GravitationalWaves
#Powerwall
#SpaceX
#Neuralink


Approach-2:
--------------------
Another approach in my mind to use the combination of Trie and PriorityQueue/minHeap. Here Trie is alternative of Map and it is memory efficient.

Data Structures:
-------------------
1. Trie: Use Trie for searching existing words and adding new words efficiently and it also maintains the frequency of words.
2. Priority Queue/Minheap: Min Heap of size k to keep top k most frequent hashTag words (where k = 10)

Time Complexity:
------------------
n + (n * m) + k = O(n * m)
where k = 10 and m is the longest length of the hashTag or word

Space Complexity:
------------------
26 + m + k = O(m + k)
where 26-letters, k = 10 elements in minHeap, m = longest word length.
